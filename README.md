#### Description of Dataset

The 2 datasets used in this capstone are the air passenger departures and air passenger arrivals. Both datasets mainly consist of passenger travels in Changi Airport from January 2000 to December 2020 (Departure) / August 2010 (Arrival) with the corresponding country and region of the travel count. The arrival dataset has a size of 7,745 rows while the departure dataset has a size of 7,811 rows.

#### General Observations
* 11 countries with over 250 million flights in 10 years
* Gradual increase in arrivals and departures year after year
* Generally higher departures than arrivals
* Sharp drop in 2003 in flights but an even sharper drop from 2019 to 2020
* Top 3 countries are located around Singapore
* Bottom 3 countries are in Europe
* Sharp increases in March and December
* Sharp decreases in February and September

#### Analysis & Insights
**1. Increase in air travel implies positive growth in air traffic, accessibility and positive impact of globalisation**
Positive growth could be due to multiple factors such as demand pattern, network connectivity, etc. As the world becomes more connected, possibly due to globalisation, increased global population, etc, the upsurged demand to travel provides opportunities to increase supply through expanding airports, catering more flight schedules and exploring new or alternative flight routes among other things.

**2. Despite increase in overall air travel to and from Singapore, multiple factors could still affect the upward trend**
As Singapore is susceptible to VUCA as the rest of the world, there are factors that could affect air traffic. Some factors include events (global, regional, local), travel distance and time of the year.

For example, a sharp drop in flights in 2003. One of the major events that happened was SARS, an airborne viral respiratory disease, which could easily be spread indirectly via surfaces touched by those infected. This displayed the capacity to spread along routes of international air travel. Similarly, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it disrupted international travel with travel bans, its impact clearly seen with even more sharper drops in flights from 2019 to 2020.

For travel distance, flights around the region have seen to increase rapidly (such as the top 3 countries) with the bottom 3 countries, mainly in Europe, maintains a steady yet slow increasing trend in flights. This could imply that European countries require long haul flights as compared to the short haul flights around the region which boasts higher frequencies of travel.

Lastly, the months of the year seems to impact air travel. For example, the increases in March and December could possibly imply the holidays for school going students while the decreases in February and September could indicate the school term. 

#### Other Comments
The datasets only include the countries of origin and destination. By including the different states of each country, the hotspots of each country could be determined which would give more insight with further analysis. This could lead to more actionable insights such as scheduling more flights during peak season or exploring alternative flight routes to break into new market.

#### Data Transformation
